# ▶ Now Playing

Show the current track and artist directly in the Raycast menu bar.

## Install `media-control` (macOS)

Now Playing uses `media-control` to detect the currently playing track.

Recommended (Homebrew):

```bash
brew install media-control
```

Verify installation:

```bash
media-control get
```

Alternative (advanced): build from source at [ungive/media-control](https://github.com/ungive/media-control).
